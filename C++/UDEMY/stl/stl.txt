WHAT IS THE STL?

-> A library of powerful, reusable, adaptable, generic classes and functions

-> Implemented using C++ templates

-> Implements commmon data structures and algorithms

-> Huge class library

-> IS AN ASSORTMENT OF COMMONLY USED CONTAINERS
    -> Known time and size complexity
    -> Tried and tested - reusable
    -> Consistent, fast, and type-safe

-> Extensible

STL HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS

-> CONTAINERS
    ->Sequence (array,vector, list, forward_list, deque)
    ->Associative (set, multi_set, map, multi_map)
    ->Adapters (stack, queue, priority queue)

-> algorithms
    -Non-modifying
    -modifying


-> Iterators
    -Generate sequences of elements from CONTAINERS
    -> Input Iterators
    -> Output Iterators
    -> Forward Iterators
    -> Bi-directional Iterators
